        <h1>KinConnect</h1>
        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          At KinConnect we strive to improve the quality of live of black
          people. In order to do so, we decided to tackle two important problems
          which are the discrimination present within the fields of healthcare,
          education, and law and the lack of oportunities of employment given to
          people of color (POC). Therefore, people of their own race will feel
          more comfortable to open up about common struggles that POC suffer
          with another black person than somebody who does suffer from this
          issues. Through our website POC can contact black professionals who
          are therapists, tutors, or lawyers and become their client.
          Consequently, the listed black people's career will be benefited
          through exposure and more experience. These three professions were
          chosen since they all requiere a deep level of empathy, understanding
          and confidency bilaterally from the client to the professional.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is it helpful?</h2>
        <p>
          Finding black professionals is difficult due to the discrimination
          they are victims to in these spaces. Particularly, "In 2015, 86
          percent of psychologists in the U.S. workforce were white, 5 percent
          were Asian, 5 percent were Hispanic, 4 percent were
          black/African-American and 1 percent were multiracial or from other
          racial/ethnic groups" (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015).
        </p>

        <p>
          Moreover, according to a study made by U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
          (2020), "there is a persistent racial gap. The employed share of
          prime-age Black workers stood at 75.7 percent from November 2018 to
          October 2019, while it averaged 80.8 percent for white workers in this
          age group".
        </p>
        <img src="img/a2.png" alt="Less access to jobs" />

        <p>
          Other alarming data is that "Among college graduates, for example, the
          Black unemployment rate averaged 2.8 percent from November 2018 to
          October 2019, 40 percent higher than the 2 percent rate for white
          college graduates in the same period" (U.S. Bureau of Labor
          Statistics, 2020)
        </p>
        <img src="img/a1.png" alt="Fewer stable jobs" />
        <p>
          So, by providing a space where black professionals are listed, it
          would be a easier way for other POC to contact them. This will also
          lead to exposure of the professionals to other prospects, which will
          boost their careers.
